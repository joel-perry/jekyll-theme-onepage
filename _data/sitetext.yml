  body: "In the summer of 2023, I partnered with David Novak Leadership to create an iOS app based on their How Leaders Lead podcast series. We began with a simple concept and had a first version in the App Store in 6 months. Then we started iterating and seeing what ideas stuck and how we could improve the platform, all in a very collaborative process. By the summer of 2024, the How Leaders Lead app was feature-complete, highly stable, and carrying an average 5-star rating.<br><br>“Joel Perry has been an integral part of helping us develop the iOS app for How Leaders Lead. From the start, he went beyond just writing code—he deeply understood our vision and was committed to translating that into a seamless user experience. Joel’s attention to detail, proactive problem-solving, and ability to anticipate our needs have been invaluable. His approach is more than just technical expertise; it’s about understanding the overall business and aligning the product with our goals. We couldn’t have asked for a better partner, and I’m excited to see how his work continues to enhance our platform.”<br>*Tim Schurrer - CEO, David Novak Leadership*"
